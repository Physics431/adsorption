    "Use this template as a starting point to carry out the analysis tasks.  For reference, here are links to recommended Python resources: the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) and the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) both by Jake VanderPlas.\n",

    "## Standard Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good idea at the beginning of your notebook to include the packages that you will need.  We will use those shown below here.  A brief description:\n",
    "* `numpy` is the foundational package for Python numerical work. It extends and speeds up array operations beyond standard Python, and it includes almost all math functions that you would need for example `sqrt()` (square root) or `cos()` (cosine).  These would be written in code as `np.sqrt()` or `np.cos()`.\n",
    "* `scipy` is a huge collection of scientific data analysis functions, routines, physicical constants, etc.  This is the second most used package for scientific work. Here we will use the physical constants library, `scipy.constants`.  Documentation is at [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) with the constants subpackage at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html.\n",
    "* `uncertainties` is a very useful small package that simplifies uncertainty propagation and printing out of quantities with uncertainty. Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is *the* standard plotting package for scientific Python.  We will use a subset called `pyplot` which is modeled after the plotting functions used in MATLAB. The last line below, `%matplotlib inline`, simply forces the plots to appear within the notebook.\n",
    "* `pandas` is a large data science package.  It's main feature is a set of methods to create and manipulate a \"DataFrame,\" which is an enlargement of the idea of an array.  I plays well with NumPy and other packages.  We will use it mainly as a way to read files into data sets in an easy way.\n",
    "* [LMFit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) is excellent for carrying out line and curve fits with many useful features."

    "\n",
    "1. Create a Python code block that will calculate an expected dosing pressure for a next dose, given the current equilibrium pressure, current adsorbed amount, and expected additional adsorbed amount.  Use this code to estimate the dosing pressure for the first 4 data points and check with the instructor or TA to make sure you are ready to start taking data.\n",
    "2. With your software code, set up the ability to make a plot similar to Figure 5 that will allow you to watch the progress of the isotherm as it is created.\n",
    "3. Collect and plot data for the argon isotherm, per the instructions.  Include a table of your pressure measurements before and after each dose along with the calculated adsorbed amount.\n",
    "4. Repeat the procedure to collect and plot data for nitrogen isotherm.  Be careful: the substep will appear between 7 and 9 torr; decrease dose sizes significantly so that you do not miss this feature.\n",
    "5. Determine the monolayer completion volume-STP of the nitrogen floating phase and the argon by using the “point B” method.  You may fit a line to a subset of points in your data, and show this line on the full data set.  Also show the location of “point B” for each set.\n"
